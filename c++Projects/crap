/* Just an update on the progress of getting a computer club at the Rolla campus. The main campus has a computer science club that we are looking to branch from. I have emailed Samantha White at the main campus and am awaiting her reply. One of the main things we are looking to accomplish is getting seated programming classes at the Rolla campus. */
